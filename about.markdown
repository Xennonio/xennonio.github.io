When I started my undergraduate studies, I learned a lot of cool things, and since then, I've been writing down interesting things that I learned every day and things that I would love to study.

Some of them become less magical as you advance, or even classic and well-known examples. But there are several that are still impressive, which are really cool to share.

Knowing this, I've always wanted to write a blog about some theorems and interesting facts that I learned in mathematics. Posts like this are on [Cool Stuff](/cool-stuffs/).

It's also undeniable that learning mathematics requires a lot of effort, reading the same thing over and over, doing lots of exercises, getting intuition and getting used to the definitions and theorems.

I feel that a lot of the motivation (at least mine) to study certain things came from interesting things that I saw in blog posts, YouTube videos or that someone told me about.

Some of this fuel, depending on the topic, is lost when you go to study it properly, and I feel that writing things down and explaining them in an interesting way always gave me more energy, which is also one of the reasons why I wanted to start a blog.

So, theorems and interesting facts that I learn are put in [TIL](/til/).
